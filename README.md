# odin-recipes

This is my submission for The Odin Project's first real project:  
**Project: Recipes**  

It's designed to show everything I've learned in the HTML Foundations
section. In short, it's a little recipe book showing three of my
favorite recipes.

It demonstrates these skills:
- Knowledge of how to create an index.html file and why you need one
- Creating boilerplate HTML
- Adding text, images, and links to a web page
- Knowing the difference between each heading level
- Using basic HTML content tags such as `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`
- Correctly using HTML attributes like `<href>`, `<src>`, and `<alt>`
- Creating proper file structure
