# odin-recipes

This is my submission for The Odin Project's first real project:  
**Project: Recipes**  

This project is designed to show everything I've learned in the HTML Foundations section. To make it more palatable to myself, I've styled it around Final Fantasy XIV. The three recipes are a dessert, beverage, and main dish from the game, respectively.

Completion of the project demonstrates these skills:

- Knowledge of how to create an index.html file and why you need one
- Creating boilerplate HTML
- Adding text, images, and links to a web page
- Knowing the difference between each heading level
- Knowing the difference between unordered and ordered lists
- Using basic HTML content tags such as `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`
- Correctly using HTML attributes like `<href>`, `<src>`, and `<alt>`
- Creating proper file structure

~~Before I leave, did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a free trial, and includes the entirety of A Realm Reborn AND the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime? Sign up, and enjoy Eorzea today!~~
