        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the butter in a small pot over low heat and let it melt completely.</li>
                <li>Add the coffee beans and let them soak in the butter for 1 hour over the lowest heat setting. More time will yield a stronger coffee flavor.</li>
                <li>Strain the coffee beans from the butter and discard them.</li>
                <li>Put the coffee butter in the refrigerator to cool and solidify.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and the coffee butter until they are light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs and vanilla and mix until they are fully combined.</li>
                <li>Add the flour, cornstarch, and salt and mix until a crumbly dough forms.</li>
                <li>Separate the dough into 2 to 4 balls, depending on the size of your work surface.</li>
                <li>Place a ball of dough between two pieces of parchment paper and roll it out to 1/4 in or 6.5 mm thick.</li>
                <li>Use a cook cutter to cut out shapes and transfer them to a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Chill the cut dough in the freezer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 F (163 C).</li>
                <li>Bake the cookies for 6 minutes, rotate and switch the pan positions, then bake for another 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let the cookies cool completely before decorating.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Caramel Topping</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Brew the ground coffee in 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water and set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>In a small pot set over low heat, combine the sugar and 1/2 cup (125 mL) of water. Allow the sugar to dissolve completely.</li>
                <li>Set the heat to medium, cover the pot with a lid, bring it to a boil, and let the solution cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until it becomes golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add the cream and whisk until it is fully combined.</li>
                <li>Add the coffee, vanilla, and salt, and whisk until they are fully combined.</li>
                <li>Take the pot off the heat, add the butter, and stir until it is fully melted.</li>
                <li>Allow the caramel to cool at least 1 hour before using it.</li>
                <li>Decorate the cookies with the caramel.</li>
            </ol>
