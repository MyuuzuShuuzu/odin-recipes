        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><i>"The surprising addition of sour cream may catch some off guard, but they will invariably be won over by the subtle harmonies of this rich blend."</i> - Eorzean Database</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Topping</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup (140g) sour cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (120 mL) whipping cream</li>
                <li>2 tbsp (20 g) sugar</li>
                <li>cinnamon (for garnish)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Espresso</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (250 mL) water</li>
                <li>5 tbsp (14 g) ground coffee</li>
            </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Topping</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the sour cream, whipping cream, and sugar in a medium bowl and whip it with a hand mixer, stand mixer, or by hand using a whisk until it holds stiff peaks.</li>
                <li>Prepare a pastry bag and tip and spoon in the cream.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate the cream until you are ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Set the cinnamon aside until you are ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: A pastry bag is not required. The cream can be spooned onto the coffee from the inside edge of the cup to create a floating layer.</p>

            <h3>Espresso</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring the water to a boil and pour it into the lower compartment of a moka pot.</li>
                <li>Put the funnel in place and fill it with ground coffee.</li>
                <li>Secure the upper compartment of the moka pot and place it on a burner set to medium high heat.</li>
                <li>Listen for a gurgling sound and open the lid.</li>
                <li>When coffee is no longer flowing, remove the pot from the heater and pour into a demitasse coffee cup.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note about coffee: Prepare the coffee according to your preference using any method. Keep in mind that a bold cup balances better with the flavors of the topping.</p>

            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pipe the cream starting from the edges of the cup in a spiral pattern.</li>
                <li>Dust the top of the cream with a pinch of cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
